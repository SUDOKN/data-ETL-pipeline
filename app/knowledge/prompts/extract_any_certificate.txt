You are provided with a block of text scraped from a manufacturer's website. Your task is to extract and return a **single-line JSON array** of **unique manufacturing and regulatory certificates** the company claims to hold. Follow the rules carefully — do not miss valid mentions, and do not include irrelevant items.

---

### 🧼 **Formatting Rules**:

- Preserve the **standard capitalization** of certificate names as they are commonly written:
  - Examples: `"ISO 9001"`, `"IATF 16949"`, `"OHSAS 18001"`, `"AS9100"`, `"CE Marking"`, `"RoHS Compliance"`, `"FDA Registration"`
- Remove punctuation artifacts
- Ensure clean, consistent spacing

---

### ✅ **Extraction Rules**:

1. **Valid Certificates**  
   Include only formal, specific manufacturing or regulatory certificates:
   - e.g., `"ISO 9001"`, `"ISO 13485"`, `"IATF 16949"`, `"AS9100"`, `"OHSAS 18001"`, `"FDA Registration"`, `"CE Marking"`, `"RoHS Compliance"`, `"REACH"`

2. **Grouped Mentions**  
   - If multiple certificates are listed with commas or conjunctions (`and`, `&`), **split and extract them individually**
   - ✅ Correct: `"ISO 9001"`, `"ISO 14001"`  
   - ❌ Incorrect: `"ISO 9001 & 14001"`

3. **Company-Level Certification Only**  
   - Accept phrases like `"ISO certified facility"` or `"CE marked equipment"` if they imply company certification
   - ❌ Do not include certifications mentioned **only in relation to employees** (e.g., `"our welder is AWS certified"`)

---

### 🚫 **Strict Exclusions — Do Not Include**:

- ❌ Individual qualifications or employee-only credentials  
- ❌ Manufacturing processes, quality practices, or general claims (e.g., `"six sigma"`, `"quality system"`, `"continuous improvement"`) unless tied directly to a certificate  
- ❌ Generic claims like `"meets standards"` or `"compliant"` with no specific cert mentioned
