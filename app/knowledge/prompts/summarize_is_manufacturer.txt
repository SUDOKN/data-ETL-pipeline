You are given a portion of text scraped from a company’s website. Your task is to extract and summarize only the information that is directly relevant to determining whether the company engages in **manufacturing or contract manufacturing** activities.  

**Important: Only include information that is explicitly stated in the input text. Do not make assumptions, do not infer beyond what is written, and do not hallucinate.**

---

### ✅ What to Include (Only if Present)
Extract any statements that relate to:

- **Physical production, processing, or fabrication** of goods  
  _(e.g., "CNC machining", "plastic injection molding", "sheet metal fabrication")_
- **Manufacturing services or capabilities** provided to clients  
  _(e.g., "custom welding", "coating services", "assembly support")_
- **Production facilities, machinery, or equipment**  
  _(e.g., "our 20,000 sq. ft. plant", "state-of-the-art machining center")_
- **Certifications or quality systems** relevant to manufacturing  
  _(e.g., ISO 9001, IATF 16949, FDA-registered)_
- **Supply chain or materials handling** in a production context  
  _(e.g., raw material sourcing, inventory control, scheduling production)_
- **After-sales production-related support**  
  _(e.g., inspection, packaging, repair, spare parts)_

---

### ❌ What to Exclude
Do **not** include:

- Generic marketing language, mission statements, or slogans  
  _(e.g., “we strive for excellence”, “your partner in success”)_
- Services unrelated to physical production  
  _(e.g., consulting, software, distribution only)_
- Inferred or assumed manufacturing references not stated directly
- Duplicate or redundant statements across the same chunk

---

### 🏷 Confidence Markers
For each relevant item, assign a **confidence marker** to indicate how strongly it supports manufacturing classification:

| Marker     | Use When                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[HIGH]`   | Statement clearly and directly describes manufacturing activity          |
| `[MEDIUM]` | Statement indirectly or partially suggests manufacturing                 |
| `[LOW]`    | Statement is vague or ambiguous, but may hint at manufacturing           |

---

### 📄 Output Format

If the chunk contains relevant information, return a **JSON object** grouping all summarized statements by their confidence level:

```json
{
  "HIGH": [
    "Summary of a clearly stated manufacturing activity"
  ],
  "MEDIUM": [
    "Summary of a moderately suggestive statement"
  ],
  "LOW": [
    "Summary of a vague or weak statement"
  ]
}
```

If no manufacturing-relevant information is found, return:

```json
{
  "HIGH": [],
  "MEDIUM": [],
  "LOW": []
}
```

### ✅ Examples:

```json
{
  "HIGH": [
    "Offers CNC machining, laser cutting, and welding services for industrial clients."
  ],
  "MEDIUM": [
    "Mentions product development and assembly support without listing specific processes."
  ],
  "LOW": [
    "States that they 'bring ideas to life' without clarifying whether this involves physical production."
  ]
}
```
