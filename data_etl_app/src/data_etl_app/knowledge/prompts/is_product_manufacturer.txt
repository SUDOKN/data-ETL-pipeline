You are given some scraped text about a manufacturer. Your task is to decide whether the company is a **product‑based manufacturer** or not.
A **product‑based manufacturer** develops, produces, and sells its **own branded products**—as opposed to only providing manufacturing services to other companies.
**Along with the Yes/No classification, you must output a `confidence` score from 0 to 100 that reflects how certain you are about your answer (higher = more certain).**
Follow the steps and indicators below, then give a concise justification that cites the relevant evidence in the text.

1. **Read the Text Carefully**
   Examine all details about the company’s products, services, and business model.
   Pay special attention to mentions of branded products, internal R\&D, or proprietary technology.

2. **Key Indicators of a Product‑Based Manufacturer**

   | Area                                 | What to Look For                                                         |
   | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Ownership of Product Design & IP** | Patents, unique designs, trademarks, proprietary tech                    |
   | **Focused Product Portfolio**        | Repeated references to specific product lines sold under their own brand |
   | **Market‑Driven R\&D & Innovation**  | Investments in research, testing, product roadmaps, new versions         |
   | **Brand Building & Marketing**       | Brand storytelling, campaigns, emphasis on brand identity                |
   | **Up‑Front Capital Investment**      | Tooling, molds, large‑scale production capacity for their own products   |
   | **Quality Control & Compliance**     | Their own standards or certifications tied to the brand                  |
   | **Supply Chain Management**          | Sourcing raw materials or long‑term supplier deals for their products    |
   | **End‑to‑End Responsibility**        | Warranties, repairs, customer support for their branded goods            |
   | **Strategic Pricing & Margins**      | Statements about setting product pricing or margins                      |
   | **Long‑Term Differentiation**        | Unique features, patented advantages, strong brand reputation            |

3. **Determine the Manufacturer Type**

   *Return **true** (product‑based) if the majority of the above indicators are present—i.e., the company designs, brands, markets, and sells its own products and invests in R\&D and distribution.*
   *Return **false** if the text primarily describes contract/job‑shop/private‑label services for other brands without owning unique products or a distinct brand identity.*

4. **Provide a Clear Answer and Brief Justification**
   Your justification should be **1 – 3 sentences** referencing the strongest indicators you found.

  "confidence": 0,           // integer 0–100 indicating certainty in the answer
  "reason": "The company explicitly states it owns patents, markets its own branded product lines, invests in R&D for future models, and handles after‑sales support."
}
```

or

```json
{
  "answer": false,
  "confidence": 0,           // integer 0–100 indicating certainty in the answer
