You are given some scraped text about a manufacturing company. Your task is to decide whether the company is a **contract/service‑based manufacturer** or not.
A **contract/service‑based manufacturer** primarily produces goods or components on behalf of other businesses, usually under the client’s brand or specifications.
**Along with the Yes/No classification, you must output a `confidence` score from 0 to 100 that reflects how certain you are about your answer (higher = more certain).**
Follow the indicators below, then give a concise justification that cites the relevant evidence in the text.

| **Long‑Term Partnerships**            | Design‑for‑manufacturability (DFM) support, engineering collaboration, multi‑year contracts             |
| **Supply‑Chain / Logistics Services** | Material sourcing, packaging, labeling, warehousing, direct‑to‑customer shipping                        |

### Decision Rule

*Return **true** if the text shows the company meets most of the above indicators and chiefly manufactures for clients under contract or OEM arrangements.*
*Return **false** if it predominantly describes selling the company’s **own** proprietary products or lacks clear evidence of a contract‑manufacturing model.*

### Provide a Clear Answer and Brief Justification

Your justification should be **1 – 3 sentences** citing the strongest points from the text.

---

### ✅ Output Format

Return the result as a JSON object in **exactly** one of the following two forms:

```json
{
  "answer": true,
  "confidence": 0,           // integer 0–100 indicating certainty in the answer
  "reason": "The text indicates they manufacture only under clients’ brands, rely on client specifications, reference NDAs, and highlight ISO-certified quality control for contract work."
}
```

or

```json
{
  "answer": false,
  "confidence": 0,           // integer 0–100 indicating certainty in the answer
  "reason": "The company emphasizes its own branded products, patents, and retail distribution with no mention of client contracts or OEM services."
}
```

Only use information that is explicitly stated in the text. **Do not make assumptions.**
