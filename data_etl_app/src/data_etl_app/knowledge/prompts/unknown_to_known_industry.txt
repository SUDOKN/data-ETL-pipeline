You are given two lists:

- **`knowns`**: A list of known industries. Each item is a JSON object with:
  - `"name"`: The canonical name of the industry (e.g., `"Automotive"`)
  - `"altLabels"`: Alternate or synonymous terms (may be incomplete).
  - `"ancestors"`: Broader industry groupings this industry belongs to (e.g., `"Manufacturing"`, `"Transportation"`).

- **`unknowns`**: A list of unstructured industry-related terms. These may be generic, trade-specific, abbreviated, or reformulated expressions of an industry.

---

### 🔍 Your Task

For each unknown term, identify the **single most specific matching known industry**.

Return a **JSON object** where:
- Each **key** is the unknown term (preserve original casing),
- Each **value** is the `"name"` of the most specific matching known industry — **always return the `"name"`, never an `altLabel`**,
- If no valid match exists, map the unknown to `null`.

**Important**:
  - **Different unknown terms may independently map to the same known industry.**
  - **It is perfectly valid for multiple unknowns to match the same known industry if they each meet the matching rules.**

### 🧠 Matching Rules

#### 1. **Exact, Synonym, or Reformulated Match**
A known industry is a match if the unknown:
- Matches its `"name"` or any `"altLabels"`,
- Or is a **widely accepted synonym**, abbreviation, or informal rephrasing of the known industry name.

> ✅ Examples:
> - `"EV"` → "Electric Vehicle" → `"Automotive"`  
> - `"Auto"` → `"Automotive"`  
> - `"Aero"` → `"Aerospace"`


#### 2. **Subtype or Specialization Match**
An unknown is a valid match to a known industry if:
- It refers to a **specific sector, market segment, or subdomain** within that industry,
- And all `"ancestors"` of the known industry are **compatible with the unknown** — no category conflicts.

> ✅ Example: `"Commercial Aircraft"` → `"Aerospace"` (a known subdomain of the industry)  
> ✅ Example: `"Electric Vehicles"` → `"Automotive"` (subsegment)  
> ❌ `"Green Energy"` → should not match `"Greenhouse Equipment"` if ancestors suggest unrelated domains.

#### 3. **Most Specific Match Wins**
- If multiple valid matches exist:
  - **Return the match with the most ancestors** (i.e., the most specific industry in the hierarchy).
  - If two matches are tied in depth, return either one.
- Only return **one match per unknown**.

#### 4. **Independent Matching**
- Each unknown is matched independently.
- It is valid for multiple unknowns to map to the same known industry.

### 🚫 Do Not

- Do **not** match based on vague or partial keyword overlap.
- Do **not** guess if the relationship is unclear or ambiguous.
- Do **not** return multiple matches for a single unknown — return only the single most specific match.

---

### ✅ Output Format

Return a valid JSON object like:

```json
{
  "Aerospace": "Aerospace",
  "Electric Vehicles": "Automotive",
  "Commercial Aircraft": "Aerospace",
  "Government Defense": "Defense",
  "Heating": null,
  "Plastics": null,
  "Communications": "Telecommunications"
}
```

- Use `null` if no valid match exists.
- Return only the `"name"` field of the most specific matching industry.
- Do not include comments, formatting, or explanations — just raw valid JSON.
