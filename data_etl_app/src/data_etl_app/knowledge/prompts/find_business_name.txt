Given text scraped from a business’s website, identify the name of the business. Return the result as JSON with a single field called name. If the business name cannot be determined from the text, return "name": null. Do not include anything else.

---

### ✅ Output Format

Return the result as a JSON object in **exactly** one of the following two forms:

```json
{
  "name": "Starbucks Coffee"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "name": null
}
```

Only use information that is explicitly stated in the text. Do **not** make assumptions.
